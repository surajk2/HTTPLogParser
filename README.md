# HTTPLogParser

HTTP log file parsing
Using the sample log file(downloaded), perform the following tasks:

Top 10 requested pages and the number of requests made for each
Percentage of successful requests (anything in the 200s and 300s range)
Percentage of unsuccessful requests (anything that is not in the 200s or 300s range)
Top 10 unsuccessful page requests
 The top 10 hosts making the most requests, displaying the IP address and number of requests made.
Option parsing to produce only the report for one of the previous points (e.g. only the top 10 urls, only the percentage of successful requests and so on)
A README file explaining how to use the tool, what its dependencies and any assumptions you made while writing it
